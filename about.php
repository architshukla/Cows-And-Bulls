          <p><strong>Cows and Bulls</strong> is a game where a player guesses a word (usually, a 4-letter word without repeating letters) given by another player. Each word is qualified as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> A <strong> "Bull" </strong> is a letter in the guessed word which appears in the same positon as it appears in the original word.</li>
            <li> A <strong> "Cow" </strong> is a letter in the guessed word which appears in a different posiiton as it appeats in the original word.</li>
          </ol>
          <br><p>Proper nouns, abbreviations and acronyms are not allowed.</p>
          <p>The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly, that is, gets "4 Bulls" on a word. Then the opponent gets to play.</p>
